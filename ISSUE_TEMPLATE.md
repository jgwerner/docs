## New Issue Check List for Features

We value your feedback to help us enhance our product. If you have a new feature that you would like to see added, describe what you have in mind. It's also helpful to provide some context, such as: what problem you are trying to solve, what the benefits to other users may be, etc.

It's possible that if we add your new issue to our backlog that we merge the issue with another one, re write it or add additional comments to obtain additional feedback.
