# 3Blades

This is the 3Blades meta repo for installation. Docs are managed with [Readme.io](https://readme.io).

3Blades was born to **accelerate modern data science**. Import data, use Notebook servers for exploratory data analysis, create visualizations and publish trained machine and deep learning models as RESTful endpoints in their native languages. All from one location!

There are two options available:

- [Online](https://3blades.io): free signup and no credit card required.
- [On-premises](https://github.com/3blades/onpremise): free community version available. Pro version adds more goodies and support services.

And yes, 3Blades is open source, **BSD** licensed!
