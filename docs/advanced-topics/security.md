Your privacy and the security of your files is very important to us. In general terms, we attempt to comply with COBIT based security processes. Although we cannot fully divulge all security initiatives via public channels, we can offer you the following summary.

  * Our service is hosted in a multi-region and multi-availability-zone setup with Amazon Web Services.
  * We attempt to leverage, wherever possible, the use of AWS managed services, such as cache clusters, database stores, brokers, notification services, task queues, among others, to reduce the risk of human error.
  * TLS encryption is enforced from all endpoints.
  * Internal communications among application servers and user servers (Notebooks, RESTful and Cron) are encrypted.
  * Data is persisted and encrypted using AES 256 in long-term data storage.
  * 3Blades DevOps team does not have access to your files, just their encrypted versions.

If you need more information, [contact us today](mailto:hello@3blades.io). we can engage with you or your company to answer any questions you may have, or add additional security features to our platform if they are deemed necessary.
