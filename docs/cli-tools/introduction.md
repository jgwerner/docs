## Coming Soon!!

3Blades CLI tools, known as `tbs`, allow users to manage all aspects of 3Blades from the terminal. This is useful for users that feel more at home in the Terminal or for engineers that wish to automate certain tasks with scripts, such as with `bash`.

We decided to rewrite our CLI Tools from the ground up with NodeJs to improve maintenance and portability.
