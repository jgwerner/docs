The first time you log into 3Blades, you will see your `My Projects` page. It will be empty to start, but this page will show all of your active projects. It includes projects owned by you and projects where you are a collaborator.

Follow these steps to get up and running with your first project:

### Add New Project

If you are in the card view (this is the default), click the **Add New Project** button on the blank project card:

If you are in the list view, click `+ Add New Project` to the right of `MY PROJECTS`.

Once you have selected the option to create a new project, you should see a web form which will allow you to set your project attributes. Project attributes are:

---
- Project owner
- Project name
- Project description
- Project visibility
---

**Public** projects can be viewed by everyone that has a valid 3Blades account. **Private** projects are only visible to the project owner and any explicitly added collaborators.

Click Create to create your project.

### Wrap Up

After creating your project, you can navigate back to the My Projects page and see your new project listed there.

That's it! You can now add files to your project, manage collaborators and launch workspaces to start working on your data science project right away.
